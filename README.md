# Stroke_prediction_using_SVM
Predicting stroke using SVM and Logistic Regression

In this project, we will predict whether a patient will have a heart stroke or not based on his/her comorbidities, work, and lifestyle. 

Data set — The stroke data is available on Kaggle

This dataset lists multiple features like gender, age, glucose level, BMI, smoking status,other comorbidities, etc., and the target variable: stroke. Each row specifies a patient’s relevant information. Following are the features listed in the dataset:
1) id: unique identifier
2) gender: “Male”, “Female” or “Other”
3) age: age of the patient
4) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn’t have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn’t have any heart diseases, 1 if the the patient has a heart disease
6) ever_married: “No” or “Yes”
7) work_type: “children”, “Govt_jov”, “Never_worked”, “Private” or “Self-employed”
8) Residence_type: “Rural” or “Urban”
9) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
10) BMI: body mass index
11) smoking_status: “formerly smoked”, “never smoked”, “smokes” or “Unknown”*
12) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not
